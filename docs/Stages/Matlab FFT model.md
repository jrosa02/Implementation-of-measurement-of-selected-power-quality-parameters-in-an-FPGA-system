# Purpose
Purpose is to create flexible base for developing, testing and validating fixed point FFT module
# Requirements 
- Input signal shake be normalized (0, 1)
- FFT should be calculated from variable input length and return variable output (compile time defined)
- There should be anti aliasing filtering
